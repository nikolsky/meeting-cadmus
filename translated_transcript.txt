%Artem: Hello What&#39;s up%Stas: Hello%Artem: Yes, yes, I can&#39;t hear it%Stas: let me hear it And me%Artem: you too%Stas: great%Artem: I&#39;m watching nothing today%Stas: I&#39;ve seen everything links from what&#39;s new I learned, I found a derivator So there is a Russian church right there is a chip, yes, but you know such a company and this one is on hagenface There is some kind of open model, just idealization, you can probably take it -there is a sentiment there, in theory Well, nothing is needed self-tapping there is, I have not tried it yet, but considering how well gpt did 100 And what it can do separately for each speaker I think that you can just use it and score% Artem: yes Well, yes, gpt sounds fucking cool. Cool, but you can do the same thing through the API% Stas: yes, yes% Artem: and it will be normal not to generate more than one character Well, that is, it’s immediate or what’s the joke% Stas: it’s fast quickly itself quickly it would well, although I still, in principle, I decline that we most likely will not have a real-time interface So I think even if it was slow, there is nothing particularly terrible in this well, the coolest thing is that you can receive an audio stream online Well, like rtp But the problem is that it is not divided by track and Probably it’s not relevant for us to bother too much either I think it’s still easier for us to work with video with a ready% Stas: completely I agree% Artem: Well, how to solve this problem yesterday I looked at these dudes who are Well, these are like And what are my competitors now and what is Google’s interface really Google can do all this for Spanish English some other languages And you include a record in it Or you can just turn on the transcript and it makes the transcript highlight the keywords Well, there is no stabilization there That is, it is like one of the documents so strong that it doesn’t exist for our language But we want to do it for our language And also for other languages \u200b\u200bwhich are not in Google and Zoom, and therefore we can kind of try Well, plus, I thought that it’s really cooler to solve our problem in Russian Well, for something, the initial drowned, perhaps English, this will be a bonus like like the main one, you really need your own and, in principle, you can try through the translation to see what happens for sure, something will turn out% Stas: excellent Yes, self-realization there, everything will be fine with text aggregation You know, it seems to me that you can translate this one, firstly, I did a search for a fool, maybe there is already some kind of library like here there is audio, but there is a video from the recorded Zuma split into tracks like by video I did not find this Unfortunately Although I thought Damn, well, I had such a thing in my life the problem before that And now I didn’t even encounter I thought maybe something even from the githaber something too lization But when we have a little, even when we have the whole record, it’s written in the middle who says it and the sound Well, in theory, you can share it Well, with a vidos, well, in principle, it’s OK there it will be with an overlay, bad problems, something else But this you can do it It&#39;s more difficult because they sometimes say something and it&#39;s written at the bottom left but you can do it too we can do it later I, too, this is exactly what I was thinking about too, and I was thinking about such an implementation when a long time ago% Stas: I wanted to eat here and the second unpleasant news I looked Well, I saw it, I just didn’t say it again yesterday that it’s strange for residents like Russia this is a work% Artem: wow% Stas: we seem to be not quite the president already We seem to be different officially but well, how would it be here I think they will not give 50 percent Even if we win something% Artem: and there it is written about Rossi or there the list of countries is %Stas: list of countries by for some reason, Brazil is there Well, then the classic list like Syria Crimea, uh Russia Iran Right, this one in these lists, by the way, it was possible Well,% Artem: Iran, as usual we are from Russia%Stas: I agree yes yes we don’t sweat or we don’t burn we don’t burn correctly Not well, other people record in Russian I think it’s normal in this regard%Artem: we can always mow the signal to look like Ukrainians%Stas: Well, I’m in fact Ukrainian% Artem: So you can make a fuss on social networks, what kind of bullshit are you humiliating us But you heard about the hackathon recently. all the little things%Stas: Well, yes, I also threw these off and asked them to open them, they didn’t open% Artem: they opened it% Stas: I also looked, they didn’t open Well, I sent you a screenshot like refracing Access% Artem: but drowning remembered yes% Stas: what we are he asked for money, he told me of course, no problem then only when they are my wife but I made an account and threw off my backup but I don’t know when they will send me a loan Well, I didn’t find anything interesting on that platform% Artem: well, okay% Stas: it’s kind of open there the idea is very similar to the thing Here But%Artem: That is, it’s like many, many models of all kinds And what kind of cohir%Stas: no not That’s which%Artem: Huber Duck replicates the replica%Stas: I don’t remember%Artem: Well, okay A uber so it&#39;s some kind of crap herest account and 8 more Get 20 hours of transcription probably That&#39;s gotta get confused%Stas: Well maybe everything is in Russian how can we be all together I look like this Well, they sort of separate both by speakers and keywords well, like everything they do% Stas: Well, yes, as I understand it, there’s like there’s like there’s just recognition And there’s recognition and a million thousand on top% Artem: and in one they return the answer, as I understand it, that is, we cannot just give them audio and say Make us a diori zation Well, Russian audio in theory is idealization, she doesn’t care in theory What language do you speak% Stas: I think yes, but I think it’s all one combine, then It won’t cope% Artem: Yes, that’s the problem, but it would be convenient of course That is, it turns out that we don’t, well, we probably will screw them anyway, but for English ones Like if English then we take everything if it’s another language then so about the idealizer something from crt is somehow not cool% Stas: I agree But there is one face, it&#39;s some kind of borrowed interface, but I think you can try to play with it% Artem: And you need to raise it in yourself or like% Stas: no, it&#39;s not him There are also jokes, everything is fine, but they are just for money, how much is it if I have to spend money, I just need to figure it out% Artem: Well, if I also have something, I can tie mine there in Turkey, there is a problem Yes, with online credit card payments% Stas: Well, it seems to work, but it is unstable here such a thing as a famous Turkish house, everything is generally different for some reason% Artem: I&#39;ll interrupt you l what you wanted to say no percentage they% Stas: And I also wanted to say that probably with English too Well, that is, we can do it like for Russian first if there is time we can do it for English but I think it’s better to do it for one language I can say like, well, in general, we are not dependent only on recognizers If you have a recognizer In this language, then our thing works we need to understand in general what kind of interface we will have, will it be Telegram or that I’m something% Stas: discussion Well, I have two options either Telegram or mail What do you think about these two% Artem: but better of course Telegram I don&#39;t really like it Because these dudes obviously don&#39;t understand what the hell is this I think maybe we can dig a little bit and suddenly we will find some kind of Open Source platform like when you upload a video there is an opportunity type text to publish and at least I almost manually fill it all in% Stas: this will probably be questions for all the south% Artem: to sexuality they could publish it somewhere I couldn&#39;t poke it% Stas: Yes, I understand you want, relatively speaking, that there was a platform of some kind of page and there is already a video and all our text that we wrote there% Artem: Well, yes Well, like yes yes, like, without any without there Password logins without anything at all, just purely like a certain front, it’s all But of course, the chance that this will work somewhere is probably 30 percent, but I would spend a little time on it, well, it seems to me Telegram, yes you just upload our classics to Telegram bot% Stas: Well, you can try% Artem: and yes, everything works But by the way, now I have turned on this checkbox in Zoom and there we will really have a separate track, that is, we kind of need to hold two modes Well, that is, here is the real ation is no longer needed in essence% Stas: When we have it now% Artem: Right now Yes, now we don’t need it, that is, the simplest thing, we can start with this% Stas: You can tie it as a separate feature later% Artem: only we won’t have such records much like now with you we will only have one such record% Stas: come on then, probably Well, it’s good for the test, one is enough, in principle, for some test, a free conversation already start working and beat somehow works between us I would suggest, for example, you are doing it So it turns out that integration with zoom disappears, I would live for you to do it from std-shka and then the text that came to us somehow send it to the user either through this magical site or through Telegram And I would do it self-realization highlighting these insiders And when I do that, it will be possible to do the implementation% Artem: Russian statistic yes% Stas: so I guess You have some experience in this regard, you probably read everything, and if ours can be great Let&#39;s ours in let&#39;s take%Artem: Well, we can take ours%Stas: I thought it would be a bit difficult%Artem: the only thing we can&#39;t publish is the login and password for this whole thing%Stas: make it prompt enter login you see the password I think it&#39;s ok especially since here I am now he said as if we would have a code deadline 100% Artem: yes, there is such a suspicion% Stas: so excellent It’s good to code morons, I think Well, we are programming Google Docs% Artem: yes, you’re ready to take it, but writes% Stas: We work : yes So it means OK the second one you offer Telegram And in some form It should be in such a way that we watch it or not% Stas: I think it&#39;s Nights of But if in theory a person should just come in and get a short sambori, it is probably assumed that he is a video %Artem doesn&#39;t want to watch: that is, he should drop the audio or the text% Stas: it&#39;s not even audio I think it&#39;s just the text in which we recognized and some type of rally was called so-and-so it was attended by ABCD for so-and-so uh%Artem: so So we have the text of course%Stas: in from% Artem: We have norms without punctuation, the only thing is that if you drop the text, you won’t have any meta-information, in theory, in theory, you need to throw audio and so that the stateshka plus all the logic happens in our code, and here’s a report for you and that&#39;s why the video is also okay Artem: Okay, I’ll look a little more about this platform If there’s a chance that it will start% Stas: if it starts up for you Please let it be If you decide that mail mail mail please if it’s homing pigeons so homing pigeons I still have to translate Let&#39;s%Artem: so ok yes By the way yes translate this is what Translate%Stas: I think through Google I&#39;m almost through the Google API it will be fine to slide exactly this%Artem: free%Stas: well, I think if it vocals the hall will be there, I think they will give me something for free. So I suggest Well, not Yandex, because it is basically normal in Russian if anyone and in principle it works almost all languages, so we will say like this% Artem: yes yes So that means there is in English, but in Russian there is no kid like% Stas: but it seems to me that translate it doesn’t take much, but if we use Russian Russian gpt, then we lose all the English text in the world that was, well, which sounded learned gpt- 3%Artem: well, yes, yes, yes% Stas: And that&#39;s why I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to be with Russians in general, and plus, back to the fact that we are multilingual for everything, like that we all hummed English there, what can you translate% Artem: logically logical A that&#39;s when you tested I understand that you first say like Do it to me and on the basis of this she does everything she works like this yes% Stas: yes yes yes yes I&#39;m like I write from morning to top like Do it yourself or for the speaker b Here that the transcript is then below I write% Artem : Well, it&#39;s some kind of freeform you, it&#39;s nothing, that is, she knows how to accept tasks from you in freeform%Stas: You just write a task%Artem: not well, the langwich model was just caught yes But the fact that you write a task for him she understands, on the one hand, it&#39;s cool, but on the other hand, it seems as if it&#39;s too universal and when everything is too universal But usually it works worse than when You clearly have a self-realizer as some kind of trained% Stas: That would be a cool Point if we they didn’t check the self-realizer Well, just because it is done if it makes free forms, then we can ask for action points and insiders the street is separated Well, it’s okay I wrote it down Listen straight Well, that’s% Artem: Damn, it’s cool, but they do it in general That’s how you like samra from volleyball inside from or it&#39;s pure made up% Stas: well, they didn&#39;t have something there Well, there&#39;s some kind of query language I just asked Just try this, I didn&#39;t rig the first two queries% Artem: cool cool or maybe you can ke ytboard is also like Key Wars is and it&#39;s also cyboards crash% Stas: I think it&#39;s possible Well, about cyboards and search by rallies, this is a cool thing, but it seems to me that Telegram works with our yuan and it will be very difficult to do so, of course, it&#39;s hard% Artem: yes yes It&#39;s hard to do I also thought yes so Well ok Yes, in principle, everything is clear% Stas: everything Okay, then let&#39;s assign the next singing maybe either when we both finish or when this one% Artem: Well, come on here around 6 o&#39;clock Oh, well, anyway now 12 Moscow time via% Stas: after 6 hours it turns out at 8:00 pm at night Come on then, let&#39;s do it an hour less% Artem: let&#39;s go at 6 pm, I meant at 6:00 pm in general, but this it turns out in 6 hours wait in 6 hours it&#39;s 6 it&#39;s 6:00 pm it&#39;s not eight no I&#39;m talking about 6 you have here I have now Moscow time 12:00 in 6 hours it will be 18 yes% Stas: so we just have more time later work the same amount until night% Artem: yes, everything is super We have the first record Aha% Stas: And then and let&#39;s give you can then make this github account to the repository I threw hello too You will write% Artem: what will we call it% Stas: I don&#39;t know I had an idea to name Yurko Yurkov this is% Artem: Come on, let&#39;s do something more universal Let&#39;s like this% Stas : Well, this is this, this is boring. I don’t know. God knows this poetry. God writes something like that. There is something you can google in this Greek mythology clerk. I think there is some kind of clerk. Come on, then I’m for universal names Yurko it was% Stas: damn it% Artem: this will be our internal name% Stas: Okay, thanks then for breaking up and until the evening, good luck to you Give the package And also, as soon as you get the first one do the transcription Please tell me I am in some format so that I can already test the trailer with them for this
