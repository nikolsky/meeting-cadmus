ArtemNikoskiy and StasPrikhodko agreed to implement text recognition for Russian audio and video with Hagenface and GPT-3 API. They discussed the potential of using Telegram and Email for user interface and Google API for translation. They decided to start with one Russian language as it will be most efficient. ArtemNikolskiy will look into potential open source platforms that can be used for the project. They agreed to follow up on the progress in the future.
