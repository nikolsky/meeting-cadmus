From the transcript of the meeting, it appears that ArtemNikolskiy and StasPrikhodko are discussing how to create a platform that can transcribe audio files in multiple languages. They are considering using Google Translate, Hagenface Terminator, Uber Duck, and a Zoom checkbox to help with the process. They also consider using Telegram Bot or an email account as the platform for the transcription. In addition, they discuss the possibility of Russian users being excluded from accessing the platform and provide possible solutions to this issue. Lastly, they talk about using Russian GPT-3 for English text in order to maximize their efforts.
