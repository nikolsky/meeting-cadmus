At the meeting, ArtemNikolskiy and StasPrikhodko discussed the challenges they were having with their environment. They agreed that it would take a long time to get the file uploaded, due to its size and an outdated version of the software. They then discussed the option of using Google to upload the audio and have a transcript of the video at the bottom of the page. Stepanov impek also suggested using a Russian implementation with an English version. Lastly, they agreed to try cutting off the first part of the audio and assembling it, with the efficiency being limited to only 3,000 words. In the end, they decided that a rally would still be unproductive if it were two hours long.
