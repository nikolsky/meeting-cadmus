 ArtemNikolskiy: So it means that there is the same hemorrhoids about Yandex. I used Yandex somehow. I think we don’t need it in Google either. then the folder of tricks, this whole hemorrhoids, that is, it’s not just one method that twitches, most likely you’ll have to First, it’s like putting this audio somewhere and then overturning the link to it 
ArtemNikolskiy: Well, at the local level, there is a python Yes, I just watched So, damn, something is not really progress, I’m really upset, I spent a lot of time to start our environment, then I tried to start it, then I realized that it’s not a damn thing wont work
 StasPrikhodko: whats wrong with that
 ArtemNikolskiy: well, no I tried on our video from the Internet Well, first of all, its a very old version, it doesnt support the entire file, it didnt even save it when it was converted because we are limited to 30 MB and files are 40 MB and then I realized that there the old version will probably have shitty quality and it will take a long time to get the file Well, it’s really very slow there, but we would, in theory, upload the file Well, audio and you open a type page where this is a video and text and good things we should get it faster
 StasPrikhodko: its true
 ArtemNikolskiy: Well, in short, I can go back to this finishing this page so that sometime, like when you upload audio to make it twitch, well, well paste the code there that will twitch this method to receive transcript and then on the page where this type of video is displayed there will be a transcript of this video at the bottom and then we put this one there that we want self-realization there we will learn how to work with Google, we don’t even have to bother with these files divided into tracks, we can just take a record in Google of a rally and simply bra 
StasPrikhodko: whats the Russian implementation? Its from assembles Yes, let me try to screw them into a pawn for English
 StasPrikhodko: I think if youve already done it here, well have to come up with something else StasPrikhodko: if we already have a page with the web, then we can make a video with a search it will look like Well, okay, Ill model it then I think Ill write a file somewhere just stupidly then display it from this file there I set it up But it works, so I wanted to keep waiting for this text on which you can test so that our rallies are some kind of
 I also wanted to throw something into Andreys bot
 StasPrikhodko: I should have used the most insane interface
 ArtemNikolskiy: No, you couldnt. Well, probably this one is theoretically possible, I don’t know, of course, I uploaded it there. It seems to me that the file is too large for it; I uploaded it even before the conversion, maybe it doesn’t support m4a files piece Stepanov impek
ArtemNikolskiy: Hi something He didnt master it I think it just doesnt work
StasPrikhodko: its also possible
ArtemNikolskiy: so science then let me continue then it t interface to cut
 StasPrikhodko: yes, let me do tt-shka and start testing this thing how to assemble it all and there is also efficiency it only supports 4.000 tokens it’s like 3.000 words to do with it
ArtemNikolskiy: Yes, youre just cutting off the first part
StasPrikhodko: Well, if you agree that the rally is unproductive for 2 hours, its still unproductive even for her
