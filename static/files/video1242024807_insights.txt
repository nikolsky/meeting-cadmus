From the meeting, it appears that ArtemNikolskiy and StasPrikhodko are discussing a project related to Google, Yandex, audio conversion, video and text creation. They discuss ways to improve efficiency by cutting off the first part of the project, and also mention Andreys bot. They discuss creating a file for English translation, and testing the interface. It seems that the project is taking longer than initially expected, as the video is limited to 30 MB and the audio files are 40 MB.
