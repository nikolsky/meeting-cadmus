ArtemNikolskiy and StasPrikhodko had a meeting discussing a research project they are working on. They are looking to develop an interface for audio transcriptions, particularly with Russian language. They are looking for an open source platform for uploads and publishing of text, however this has proved difficult. ArtemNikolskiy suggests using a Telegram bot for uploads and StasPrikhodko suggests using Google API for translations. They also consider using Zoom for audio transcription but it might take more time and effort. They agree to look into the options further and decide which one to use.
