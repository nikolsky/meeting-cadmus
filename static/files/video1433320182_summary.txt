 say in principle we can do everything else in Russian and then we add on top of it well, English and something else No, if you want, we can make a conditional translation to English and then we will naturally put English only English, because the English version has not been done yet

ArtemNikolskiy and StasPrikhodko discussed potential options for implementing a transcription system in Russian and English languages. They explored the potential of an open source platform to input audio as well as text which could be easily transcribed into both languages. They considered leveraging the Zoom platform in order to share tracks, as it is already established with an API. They also discussed the use of Telegram or email for the delivery of transcripts. Lastly, the conversation ended with the conclusion that the Russian language will be given priority in its development, but English will also be included to give greater reach.
